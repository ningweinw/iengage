# Enhancing Digital Media Management with Azure AI Vision

## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving digital media and advertising industry, companies are constantly seeking innovative ways to manage and enhance their vast repositories of digital assets. Contoso, a global leader in digital media management, faces the challenge of efficiently organizing, annotating, and enhancing a massive library of images and videos.

### Problem Statement
Contoso is facing significant challenges in managing and enhancing its vast library of digital media assets, which includes images and videos. The company needs to improve the accessibility, searchability, and visual appeal of these assets to meet the needs of their clients and stay competitive in the market. The specific challenges they are encountering include:

* The company has a large number of images that lack descriptive alt text and captions, making them less accessible to visually impaired users and harder to search and categorize.

* Many images contain important text information that needs to be extracted and indexed to improve searchability and content management.

* Contoso needs to analyze images to determine whether they are in black and white or color, and identify the dominant colors. This information is crucial for categorizing images and making design decisions.

* The company frequently needs to isolate subjects in images by removing backgrounds. This is essential for creating marketing materials and enhancing visual content.

* Contoso has specific client needs that require custom models to identify brand logos and other custom objects in images and videos. The company needs to develop and deploy these custom models efficiently.

### Tasks 
Help contoso to overcome the above challenges by answering the below questions.


1. How can Contoso improve accessibility and searchability?

   <div id="solution1" style="display:none;">
     <p>Contoso can use Azure Computer Vision's Image Analysis API to automatically generate alt text and captions for their images. This feature uses AI models to analyze the visual content of images and generate one-sentence descriptions that can be used as alt text. The key benefits of having descriptive alt text and captions include improved accessibility for visually impaired users, better search engine optimization (SEO), and enhanced user experience by making images more discoverable and understandable.</p>

   </div>

2. What steps should Contoso take to extract text from images? How can the extracted text be used to enhance the searchability and management of media content?

   <div id="solution2" style="display:none;">
     <p>Contoso should use Azure Computer Vision's OCR feature to extract text from images. The steps include:
       <ol>
         <li>Upload images to Azure Blob Storage.</li>
         <li>Use the OCR API to analyze the images and extract text.</li>
         <li>Store the extracted text in a searchable database.</li>
       </ol>
       The extracted text can be used to enhance searchability by indexing the text content, making it easier to find specific information within the media library. It also aids in content management by providing metadata that can be used for categorization and tagging.</p>

3. How can Contoso detect whether images are in black and white or color? What methods can be employed to identify the dominant colors in images, and how can this information be utilized for categorization and design purposes?
   <button onclick="toggleSolution('solution3')">Show Solution</button>
   <div id="solution3" style="display:none;">
     <p>Contoso can use Azure Computer Vision's color detection feature to analyze images and determine whether they are black and white or color. The feature also identifies the dominant foreground and background colors, as well as the overall dominant colors in the image. This information can be used to categorize images based on color schemes and make informed design decisions for marketing materials and visual content.</p>

4. What techniques can Contoso use to remove backgrounds from images and isolate subjects? How can background removal improve the quality and versatility of marketing materials and visual content?
   <button onclick="toggleSolution('solution4')">Show Solution</button>
   <div id="solution4" style="display:none;">
     <p>Contoso can use AI-powered tools like Microsoft Designer or Azure Computer Vision's background removal feature to remove backgrounds from images. These tools use advanced algorithms to accurately detect and remove backgrounds, leaving the main subject isolated. Background removal improves the quality and versatility of marketing materials by allowing designers to place subjects on different backgrounds, create transparent images, and enhance the overall visual appeal of content.</p>

5. How can Contoso identify brand logos and other custom objects? What are the steps involved in this process?
   <button onclick="toggleSolution('solution5')">Show Solution</button>
   <div id="solution5" style="display:none;">
     <p>Contoso can use Azure Custom Vision to develop and deploy custom models for identifying brand logos and other custom objects. The steps involved include:
       <ol>
         <li>Collect and label images of the objects to be detected.</li>
         <li>Create Custom Vision resources in the Azure portal.</li>
         <li>Train the custom model using the labeled images.</li>
         <li>Test and evaluate the model's performance.</li>
         <li>Deploy the model and use it to scan new media assets.</li>
       </ol>
       To ensure accuracy and reliability, the company should use a diverse set of training images, regularly update the model with new data, and continuously monitor its performance.</p>
